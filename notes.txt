v6 updates:

    - Class selection at lev 5??? <-- DONE FINALLY
    - More monster subclasses <-- Not Done


Class Updates:

    - Prestiging: How this works is that the base stats are added to your leveled up stats. 
                  (Ex: If you had 60 strength as an Archer, you would now get 120 if you upgraded
                  to Sniper. This is due to Sniper having 60 extra base strength. Which also means
                  that items and whatnot are also carried on over. I feel like this won't be detrimental 
                  to players who might see the first 5 levels are "trash". 
    - Boss Fight: This may prove really challenging, so I will tweak it in the future. The way to beat it
      is to purchase ????? as it is very similar to a "extra life".
    - New Classes such as Dialogue to house some dialogue that happens, additionally, UndeadOProtag.java does
      not work in any way, it was merely experimental. 


Enjoy the Game!
