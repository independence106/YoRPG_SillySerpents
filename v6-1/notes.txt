Class Updates:

    - Prestiging: How this works is that the base stats are added to your leveled up stats. 
                  (Ex: If you had 60 strength as an Archer, you would now get 120 if you upgraded
                  to Sniper. This is due to Sniper having 60 extra base strength. Which also means
                  that items and whatnot are also carried on over. I feel like this won't be detrimental 
                  to players who might see the first 5 levels are "trash".
